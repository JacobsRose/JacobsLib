Instructions:
    
Injecting the module in to your script:

    local Async = require("PathToTheModule")

Creating an Async function:

    local YourNewAsyncFunction = Async(function(callback, ...) *Code here* end)\

    Pay attention, given "callback()" is used instead of "return".

Running Async function from anywhere without waiting until it ends its job

    YourNewAsyncFunction(...)

Running Async function FROM INSIDE OF ANOTHER Async function with waiting till the end

    local result = YourNewAsyncFunction(...)()
