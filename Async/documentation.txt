Creating an Async function:

    local YourNewAsyncFunction = Async(function(callback, ...) *Code here* end)\

    Pay attention, given "callback()" is used instead of "return".

    Pay attention, you can not create async OOP-like functions with "self" hidden

    In this case, async function should look like this:
    
    object.useAsync = Async(function(callback, self, ...)

        **CODE** 

        callback()
    end)

    Using: 

    local result = object:useAsync(...)()

Running Async function from anywhere without waiting until it ends its job

    YourNewAsyncFunction(...)

Running Async function FROM INSIDE OF ANOTHER Async function with waiting till the end

    local result = YourNewAsyncFunction(...)()
