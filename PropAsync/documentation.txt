Instructions:
    
Creating prop/seat/custom/component just like the common command but with "Async in the end":

    prop.create => prop.createAsync

    prop.createCustom => prop.createCustomAsync

Creating prop without waiting for result: 

    prop.createAsync(pos, ang, model, frozen)

Creating prop and waiting for result inside of async function

    local chair = prop.createCustom(pos,ang,model,frozen)()
